## Building

Karen can be built as a normal csproj app, but requires a [LANraragi MSYS2 VFS](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi/blob/dev/tools/build/windows/create-dist.sh) added to its build output to really do anything.  
The VFS needs to be added to a `lanraragi` subfolder, ie: `Karen/bin/win-x64/publish/lanraragi`.

The MSI (Setup wixproj) can just be built as-is once this is done.
